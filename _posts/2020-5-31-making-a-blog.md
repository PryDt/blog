I'm committing to writing a blog. This may or may not be my 3rd attempt and I'm just going to go and stick with it. I think that's the best course of action. Previously, I was too caught up with what static site generator to use or exactly what to post and this time I'm just sticking with something basic and will continue. 

My set up for blogging is rather simple. I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is not the newest or flashiest static site generator but it gets the job done. The theme I am using is called [Sidey](https://github.com/ronv/sidey) and I personally think it looks amazing.

I suppose that's it for now. This is just the first post.
