<p>I’m committing to writing a blog. This may or may not be my 3rd attempt and I’m just going to go and stick with it. I think that’s the best course of action. Previously, I was too caught up with what static site generator to use or exactly what to post and this time I’m just sticking with something basic and will continue.</p>

<p>My blogging set up is just a git repo that has a Jekyll site in it. The theme I am using is called <a href="https://github.com/ronv/sidey">Sidey</a> and I personally think it looks amazing.</p>

<p>That’s all for the first post.</p>

<p>– pry</p>
