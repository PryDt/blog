The most sad thing about the novel is that while the novel was published in 1973, all of Vonnegut’s criticisms of America hold true more than ever. Racism, sexism, and inequality are all still large problems that need fixing in 2020. Overall I would say the satrical and witty comedy is worth a read and still ends with a touch of hope as it shows that even a single person (Kilgore Trout in this case), can cause change in magnitudes.Rating: 7/10, not my favorite Vonnegut book but definitely worth your time.– pry",
