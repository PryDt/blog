      <description>Programming languages to hackers are tools and many craftspeople take great pride in their tools of choice. Tools often come with trade offs and the most skilled craftspeople know precisely when to use a tool and perhaps most importantly, when not to.

But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.</description>
